# Tesla-stock-prediction
this a time series forecasting using FbProphet
Generally in time series forecasting LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) is used but in this example a python library called FbProphet is used.
It is easy to use and highly specific in nature which you can realise if you read my code.But it is highly analytical and can predict and even show trends based on Days,Months and years so i tried to use this library for stock prediction. It is highly useful for Stock Price Prediction Projects
